      <p class="about-ex">
        Wander Travels was founded on the basis of helping travelers create a safe and cost-efficient itinerary for their travels. 
        Our goal has always been to allow travelers to <b>Wander Without a Care</b> in the world to emphasize how safe their planned 
        itinerary has been. When travelling abroad for vacation, we are aware that many travelersâ€™ greatest concerns surround their safety. 
        Travelers look into the potential of political terror and violent crimes occurring for their desired country to travel to, and solo 
        travelers specifically look at the safest places to travel to with a budget. With over two-thirds of travelers placing safety and 
        security as their highest prioritization when planning their vacations, we have given explorers ease of access in understanding 
        the safety of their travels.  
      </p>
      <p class="about-ex">
        When users explore our website, they will see on our homepage a criminal index, safety index, and price range for each location 
        they could possibly travel to. 
        <ul class="about-ex">
          <li>A <b>Criminal Index</b> indicates how susceptible a crime is to occur at the location on a 0-100 scale, where 100 is the safest.</li>
          <li>A <b>Safety Index</b> indicates how protected a location is on a 0-100 scale, where 100 is the most protected.</li>
          <li>The <b>Average Cost for 7-day Solo Trip</b> includes shelter, food, and tourist attraction fees for the location. 
              It does not include the cost of the flight.</li>
