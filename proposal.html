            <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>

            <p>When travelling abroad for vacation, many travelers’ greatest concerns surround their safety. 
            Travelers look into the potential of political terror and violent crimes occurring for their 
            desired country to travel to, and solo travelers specifically look at the safest places to 
            travel to with a budget. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/international-travelers-concerned-safety/index.html">CNN</a>
            even stated that from their global survey, over two-thirds of survey respondents voiced that 
            safety and security was placed at a high prioritization when planning their vacations.</p>

            <p>However, many of these travelers don’t have resources to help them identify the safest places 
            to travel to while on a budget. There are many online travel web/mobile applications that help 
            users plan their travel experience based on user-recommendations, like 
            <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/">Trip Advisor</a> and 
            <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/visit-a-city-offline-guides/id985996026">Visit a City</a>
            Although these applications prioritize information regarding transportation, activities, restaurants, 
            and etc. to their users and don’t show whether their desired tourist attractions are certified to be 
            safe and how much they cost, leaving users having to find this information for themselves. 
            Additionally, many of these applications do not provide information on 
            <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/students-abroad/pdfs/911_ABROAD.pdf">safety numbers</a>
            for the police or firemen in the country they are travelling to. This results in many lone travelers 
            with increased vulnerability when in emergency situations. To provide an ease of access to all of this 
            information, our team’s goal is to develop a data organization web application to help lone travelers 
            create an itinerary of their vacation that contains information for their total cost and how safe 
            it will be.</p>

            <h2>App Description</h2>

            <p>We intend for the main users of our application to be individuals who are focused on traveling to safe 
            locations with low violent crimes. The application could be especially useful for those who do lots 
            of solo travel and want to explore the world on their own, safely. Once on the website, users will 
            be able to view information about some of the <a href="https://www.smartertravel.com/safest-countries-ranked/">safest places</a> 
            to travel in the world. Example countries we would present traveling information for are: 
            <ul>
                <li>Australia</li>
                <li>Sweden</li>
                <li>New Zealand</li>
                <li>Italy</li>
                <li>Netherlands</li>
            </ul>
            They will also be able to view 
            <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/students-abroad/pdfs/911_ABROAD.pdf">emergency contact numbers</a>
            for the different countries on the website to increase safety awareness. Along with this information, 
            users will have the ability to view the prices of safe activities to do in the potential locations 
            they would like to travel to. Lastly, once users browse the different locations and activities, they 
            have the option to create an itinerary where they can view the total price of their selected plans.</p>

            <p>With this web app, one of the main forms of interaction users will have is being able to view tourist 
            attractions and add them to their itinerary. While exploring the different attractions on the website, 
            they will also be able to click (or possibly hover) on each one of the attractions to see the fees, 
            ticket costs etc. Using this app will help many as it will give users ideas for safe locations to travel 
            to by themselves as well as providing emergency contact information for specific countries of interest to 
            promote safety. Providing the emergency contact information for police, firestation, ambulance etc is 
            especially important because many travelers go on vacations without this knowledge and such information 
            could potentially save lives. Having an itinerary through the app will also give users a better idea of 
            what their budget will look like for their vacation/travels so that they won’t be overspending. Overall, 
            our app will give users a chance to create a plan for a safe, budget friendly vacation.</p>
