# Project 1

This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

This website will be a one-stop site for planning and choosing perfect tourist destinations that are certified to be safe for all kinds of travel as well as for solo travelers on a budget. It will provide ideas of potential places for users that would be safe to travel and tourist attractions they could choose to visit in these specific locations. With the enhanced feature of selecting the available itineraries including the total price of the trip from the start to finish, travelers wonâ€™t be overspending their budget. Additionally, to promote safety, safe locations with low violent crime rates and important phone numbers will be provided in case of an emergency.
