              beneath the earth's surface.

              More than 20 million people have visited since the museum opened in 1990, and it's not hard to see why. In 1628 the 
              pride of the Swedish Imperial fleet, the Vasa battle ship, sank on its maiden voyage.

              Stockholm's Old Town is known as Gamla Stan, a small concentrated area where the city began in the middle of the 
              13th century. Much of the medieval enclave remains, although in typical Scandinavian style, it is freshly brushed and 
              painted. Its charm is in the architecture along its narrow stone-paved lanes and around its squares, especially the main 
              one, Stortorget, surrounded by old merchants' houses.

              scenery.
